Games Topic course with Dr. Rodrigo Canaan.

## Acknowledgement

This repository is a fork, and owes great debt to, the botting API made by
phughesion, besteon, and giewev on Github. This work wouldn't have been possible
without theirs.

## Installation

1. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt` (and ideally torch separately for gpu support)
2. Install the lovely injector and steammodded (see https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki)
3. Clone/download this repository into the created `mods` directory
4. Pray to a higher power of your choosing that it decides to work properly

## Usage

Run the bot script in a python environment with torch available

### Flush Agent

```bash
python flush_bot.py
```

### DQN Agent

```bash
python dqn_card_agent.py
```

## Figures

Figures from the report can be found in `vis.ipynb`, using data generated by
`dqn_card_agent.py` during training (with a epsilon-greedy
threshold of 0.05 used during evaluation for the DQN.) Also, a guide on how
figures for the flush bot were created is in the file `flush_bot_evaluation.pdf`.
