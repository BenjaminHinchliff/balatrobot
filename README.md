https://github.com/besteon/balatrobot/assets/103706338/f489169c-7045-4935-a968-aa33a1031304


## Installation

Requires Steamodded 0.7.2 (Untested with latest version)
Just unzip and put the balatrobot folder under your Mods folder.

## Botting

THIS MOD DOES NOT CONTAIN A FINISHED BOT, JUST THE API.

To make your own bot, modify Bot.lua. There is also an example in the examples folder to get you started (it isn't very good...).
